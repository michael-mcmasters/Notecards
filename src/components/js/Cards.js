Even though we can add nodes without reorganizing the entire data structure it still has many disadvantages. The disadvantages include using more memory then arrays because of the storage of the pointers and that search operations are slow due to nodes being accessed sequentially. ",

The three main operations that can be performed on stacks are inserting an item into the stack (push), deleting an item from the stack (pop), and displaying the contents of the stack (peek or top). Advantages of this data structure are that it allows you to control how memory is distributed, it is not easily corrupted and helps you manage data in LIFO order. Disadvantages of this database is that stack memory is limited and that variable storage will be overwritten which sometimes leads to undefined behavior of the function or program.",
