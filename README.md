### Notecards
A colorful notecard app to help with studying. Use the arrow keys to cycle through each card and the space key to flip them over. Click on a card to edit its content.

Created with a modern design and smooth transitions, my inspiration for making this site was because most flashcard apps out there are functional but look dated. I wanted to create something that was easy on the eyes while also being useful. The web app is still a work in progress, but I'm excited about how it's coming out.
